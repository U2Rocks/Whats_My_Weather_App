# Whats My Weather?

## Summary

This is a simple web app that allows a user to look up the current weather in any city on the globe&reg;.

## Build

This app was built with React and uses Tailwindcss for styling the application.
-- OpenWeather API is used to get weather data for the inputted location.  
-- Axios is used for managing API calls.  
-- emoji-dictionary was used to get emojis to show up properly in the header.  
-- jest was used to try and setup automated tests

-- Neither of the tests are currently operational(comments in test files)

-- Geolocation API can spit out incorrect cities occasionally(especially with smaller cities)
